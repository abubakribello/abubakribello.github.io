            <h2>The 40-Hour Bottleneck</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Most growing businesses hit the same wall: your team is drowning in repetitive work, but you can't afford to double headcount.</p>

                    <p>Your recruiters spend 20+ hours/week screening CVs. Your marketing team wastes 15 hours manually repurposing content. Your founder does 8 hours of bookkeeping every week.</p>

                    <p>Hiring more people is expensive and slow. Off-the-shelf tools (Zapier, Make) break on edge cases. Big consulting firms charge £50K-£200K for 6-month projects.</p>

                    <p>Every hour spent on data entry, screening, or content creation is an hour NOT spent on strategy, client relationships, or closing deals.</p>
                    <p class="problem-cost">Cost: Opportunity cost compounds weekly</p>

                        <p>Recruiters spent 25+ hours per week manually matching candidates to roles. The process was slow, inconsistent, and prevented the team from focusing on client relationships and business development. With growth targets doubling, the manual approach was unsustainable.</p>

                        <h4>The Solution</h4>
                        <p>I designed an AI-powered matching engine that automatically evaluates every candidate against open roles using structured criteria. The system analyzes CVs, candidate profiles, and job requirements in seconds, scores matches across six dimensions, generates bidirectional matches, and logs transparent match explanations for recruiter review.</p>

                    <h3>How do I know this will work for my business?</h3>
                    <p>We start with a 90-minute operational audit (complimentary). I'll identify 3-5 high-impact automation opportunities, estimate time savings, and provide an ROI projection. You'll know if it makes sense before committing.</p>

                    <h3>What if the system breaks or makes mistakes?</h3>
                    <p>Every system includes built-in error monitoring and alerting. If something breaks, you're notified immediately. I also include 30 days of post-launch support to handle any issues and fine-tune performance.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much technical knowledge does my team need?</h3>
                    <p>None. The system runs in the background. Your team interacts with it through familiar tools (Slack, email, spreadsheets). I provide training, but most clients are up and running within a day.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I make changes after launch?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. You get full documentation and access to the system. Many clients make minor tweaks themselves. For larger changes, I offer ongoing support retainers or one-off enhancement projects.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the typical ROI timeline?</h3>
                    <p>Most clients see positive ROI within 8-12 weeks. High-volume operations (recruitment, customer support, content production) often see ROI within 4-6 weeks.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you work with companies outside these industries?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. While I've delivered the most projects in recruitment, marketing, and professional services, I've also built systems for property management, e-commerce, healthcare administration, and legal ops. If you have repetitive manual work, I can likely automate it.</p>
